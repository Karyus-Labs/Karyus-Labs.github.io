## Engineering Portfolio: From Physics to Simulation

Each project represents a deep dive into the "Engineering Workflow," moving from theoretical physics to high-fidelity implementation.

### Cessna 182 Nonlinear Flight Simulator
Developed as part of the Flight Dynamics (SAA0184) coursework at EESC-USP.

* **Longitudinal Dynamics:** Built a high-fidelity nonlinear simulator in Simulink by implementing raw equations of motion block-by-block.
* **Data Validation:** Compared linearized state-space models against full nonlinear behavior to assess the limits of aerodynamic simplifications.
* **Trim Calculation:** Integrated MATLAB scripts for precise aircraft trim equilibrium points prior to simulation runs.

### EESC-USP AeroDesign
Contributed to the design and financial sustainability of high-performance competition aircraft.

* **Stability & Control:** Responsible for complete stability analysis and control surface sizing using XFLR5 and AVL.
* **Flight Data Matching:** Performed complex data matching between flight telemetry and simulation models to calibrate stability and inertia derivatives.
* **Strategic Partnerships:** Led the department as Sponsorship Director, securing 17 global partners and managing resources from multinationals like Tractian, Henkel, and STMicroelectronics.
