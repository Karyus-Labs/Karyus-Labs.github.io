### Strategic Vision
My journey in engineering is driven by a singular goal: to bridge the gap between classical Aeronautical Engineering and the transformative power of Artificial Intelligence. Currently pursuing a double degree between École Centrale Méditerranée and EESC-USP, I focus on solving high-complexity problems through simulation, automation, and mathematical rigor.

### Technical Foundation & Research
My expertise was built on the front lines of competitive engineering and academic research:

* **Flight Mechanics & Control:** Specialized in stability analysis and control sizing, utilizing tools like XFLR5, AVL, and MATLAB/Simulink to validate flight telemetry against simulation models.
* **Data Science & NLP:** Conducted research as a PICME scholarship recipient (IMPA & CNPq), developing data intelligence platforms and applying NLP to process large-scale industrial datasets.
* **Optimization & Algorithm Theory:** Background includes rigorous theoretical research in Graph Theory and computational complexity, providing the analytical depth required for Deep Tech development.

### Milestones
* **Embraer HackaSEA Challenge:** Winner.
* **SAE AeroDesign:** Awarded in both International and National competitions.
* **Leadership:** Served as Sponsorship Director for AeroDesign, managing a portfolio of 17 global partners including Tractian, Henkel, and STMicroelectronics.

### Core Stack
* **Languages:** Python (Data Science/Automation), MATLAB/Simulink (Control/Simulation).
* **Aerospace Tools:** XFLR5, AVL, Ansys (Fluent/CFX).
