### Strategic Vision
[cite_start]My journey in engineering is driven by a singular goal: to bridge the gap between classical Aeronautical Engineering and the transformative power of Artificial Intelligence[cite: 573, 576]. [cite_start]Currently pursuing a double degree between **École Centrale Méditerranée** and **EESC-USP**, I focus on solving high-complexity problems through simulation, automation, and mathematical rigor[cite: 562, 565, 575].

### Technical Foundation & Research
My expertise was built on the front lines of competitive engineering and academic research:

* [cite_start]**Flight Mechanics & Control:** As a former member of the **EESC-USP AeroDesign Team**, I specialized in stability analysis and control sizing, utilizing tools like XFLR5, AVL, and MATLAB/Simulink to validate flight telemetry against simulation models[cite: 568, 569, 600, 602, 603, 605].
* [cite_start]**Data Science & NLP:** At **ICMC-USP**, I conducted research as a PICME scholarship recipient (IMPA & CNPq), developing data intelligence platforms and applying NLP to process large-scale industrial datasets[cite: 580, 581, 582, 584, 585].
* [cite_start]**Optimization & Algorithm Theory:** My background includes rigorous theoretical research in Graph Theory and computational complexity, providing the analytical depth required for Deep Tech development[cite: 588, 589, 590].

### Milestones
* [cite_start]**Embraer HackaSEA Challenge:** Winner[cite: 558].
* [cite_start]**SAE AeroDesign:** Awarded in both International and National competitions[cite: 559].
* [cite_start]**Leadership:** Served as Sponsorship Director for AeroDesign, managing a portfolio of 17 global partners including Tractian, Henkel, and STMicroelectronics[cite: 594, 596].

### Core Stack
* [cite_start]**Languages:** Python (Data Science/Automation), MATLAB/Simulink (Control/Simulation)[cite: 574, 577].
* [cite_start]**Aerospace Tools:** XFLR5, AVL, Ansys (Fluent/CFX)[cite: 561, 569, 577].
* [cite_start]**Soft Skills:** Agile Project Management (Scrum), Strategic Negotiation[cite: 552, 556, 571, 572].
