description: "How I adapted analytical models and architected a Simulink environment to bridge the gap between theory and flight physics."
---

In aerospace engineering, we spend years studying linearized models. They are the bread and butter of control design, but they often feel like "paper planes"—elegant in theory, but detached from the messy, non-linear reality of flight.

During the **Flight Dynamics** (SAA0184) course at **EESC-USP**, I had the chance to bridge this gap. My goal wasn't to reinvent the math, but to take the analytical framework and the base scripts provided by **Prof. Ricardo Angélico**, adapt them, and architect a modular **Simulink** simulator to see if the linear predictions would actually hold up.

## The Scope: Adaptation and Architecture

Engineering is often about taking a solid foundation and making it work for a specific, complex mission. My contribution to the *Zona de Turbulência* group was focusing on the computational integration.

### 1. From Script to Solver
Starting with the core MATLAB algorithms, I adapted the **Newton-Raphson** routines to calculate the trim conditions for a **Cessna 182**. This meant ensuring the solver could handle the aerodynamic derivatives from **Roskam (Appendix B)** to find the equilibrium ($V, \alpha, \delta_e, T$) for our specific flight envelope.

### 2. High-Fidelity Implementation
In the Simulink environment, I translated the longitudinal equations of motion into a modular block architecture. Instead of using $u$ and $w$ (body-fixed velocities), I used the total airspeed $V$ and the angle of attack $\alpha$, as they align directly with how lift and drag forces are modeled.

The system solves the non-linear coupling in real-time:

$$
\begin{cases}
\dot{V} = \frac{1}{m} (T \cos\alpha - D - mg \sin(\theta - \alpha)) \\
\dot{\alpha} = \frac{q \cos\alpha - (L + T \sin\alpha - mg \cos(\theta - \alpha))}{mV} \\
\dot{q} = \frac{M}{I_y} \\
\dots
\end{cases}
$$

## The "Eureka" Moment

There’s a unique satisfaction in seeing two lines on a graph overlap perfectly after hours of debugging signal routings and unit conversions. To test the models, we injected a **1-degree elevator step input** to trigger the aircraft's natural modes: the fast **Short Period** and the slow **Phugoid**.

When I overlaid the response of my **Non-Linear Simulink** model with the **Linear State-Space** model, the tracking was almost perfect for small perturbations.

**The Lesson Learned:** This project wasn't just a validation of a classroom exercise; it was a validation of the tools. It built my confidence in knowing when a simple linear model is a surgical instrument and when the full non-linear physics must take over.
