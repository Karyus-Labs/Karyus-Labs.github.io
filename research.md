## Scientific Research & Academic Foundation

My research activities focus on the intersection of mathematical optimization, computational complexity, and data intelligence.

### PICME - Undergraduate Research (IMPA & CNPq)
Recipient of the prestigious Program of Scientific Initiation and Master's Degree (PICME) managed by the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IMPA). 

* **Algorithms & Graph Theory:** Conducted rigorous theoretical research on the mathematical foundations of computer science, focusing on implementation complexity and mathematical proofs independent of applied tasks.
* **Automotive Market Intelligence (CarReliability):** Developed a full-stack data intelligence platform. Built a scraping pipeline to process over 140,000 consumer reviews and developed a proprietary "Reliability Score" algorithm using Sentiment Analysis to categorize defects across 20 automotive brands.

### Aeronautical Research Week (SEA)
Member of the Organizing Committee for the XXI Aeronautical Engineering Week at EESC-USP.

* **Speaker Curatorship:** Identified and recruited industry experts to align presentation themes with technical academic goals.
* **Logistics Coordination:** Managed transportation and organization for student technical trips to major aerospace companies.
